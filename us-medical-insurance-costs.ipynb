We can observe how the **southeast** region leads all other regions in the amount of total smokers and the amount paid on average on insurance. We can also observe that despite the **southwest** having a higher average BMI, being slightly older on average, and having slightly more children on average *still manages to pay less on average than the **northeast** region, simply because they have fewer smokers*.\n",
